about the OUTPUT--

I've fllowed your lesson,googled and watched youtube.But i couldnt do it. somehow it is not working.

I did create 
<ol> and <li class = ex1> in html first,

and typed let ele = document.querySelector(.'ex1')
          ele.textContent = ------- in java.
          
but after type that, it is not working and turn red on console.

So right now, i just submitted. but i will try more and fix it. Can i upload later again? 
Thank you:)
